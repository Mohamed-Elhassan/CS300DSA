Project Portfolio Reflection
This repository showcases two projects that demonstrate my understanding of data structures and algorithms. The first project involved analyzing runtime and memory usage across various data structures, while the second required implementing a sorting algorithm to arrange courses in alphanumeric order. Together, these projects display my progress and learning in writing efficient, maintainable code.

Reflection
What was the problem you were solving? - 

In these projects, I tackled two main problems. The first was analyzing and understanding the runtime and memory characteristics of different data structures. I explored how different choices can impact performance, especially with large data sets, which is crucial for building efficient software. The second project focused on implementing a sorting solution to organize a list of computer science courses in alphanumeric order, applying fundamental algorithmic principles to achieve correct and efficient results.

How did you approach the problem? - 

My approach emphasized choosing the appropriate data structures to match each problem's requirements. I aimed to maximize efficiency and minimize resource use, which is key in software development, where optimized code can lead to better performance and scalability. Understanding data structures allowed me to make informed decisions about which structures would provide the best runtime and memory efficiency for specific tasks, reinforcing the importance of this knowledge in software design.

How did you overcome any roadblocks? - 

Throughout the projects, I encountered challenges, such as selecting the best data structure to meet specific constraints and debugging issues in my sorting code. To overcome these, I revisited foundational concepts and tested different structures to see how they handled various data types and sizes. I found that breaking problems into smaller parts and testing incrementally was an effective strategy for troubleshooting and validating my solutions.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? - 

Working on these projects has shifted my approach to software design. I now prioritize analyzing each task's needs carefully before deciding on the data structures and algorithms to use. This structured approach has made me more mindful of factors like scalability and maintainability, which are essential for writing high-quality, production-ready code.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? - 

Through these projects, I have improved my coding style to produce code that is not only efficient but also maintainable and easy to read. Iâ€™ve adopted best practices such as clear variable naming, modular function design, and thorough documentation. These habits ensure that my code is adaptable to future requirements, making it easier for others (and my future self) to understand and expand upon my work.
